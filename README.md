# Circa Diem toolbox
Matlab toolbox for plotting and analysis of circadian patterns in data.
 
The Circa Diem toolbox is designed to generate circadian visualisations and analyses of data points with associated Matlab 'datetime' values.

Circa Diem also allows for some statistical tests of the extent of non-uniformity of circadian patterns. For this, the toolbox is heavily indebted to the 'circstat_matlab' toolbox by Philipp Berens (some of the statistical functions are essentially wrapper functions around circstat functions).

# Dependencies
This toolbox makes use of a number of the circular statistics functions in 'Circstat':
